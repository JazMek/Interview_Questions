           /*
      Java program to to sort a given array 'in place' in ascending order using Bubble Sort algorithm.
      Write a method that takes in an array of ints and uses the Bubble Sort algorithm
      to sort the array 'in place' in ascending order. The method should return the same,
      in-place sorted array.
      Note:  Bubble sort is one of the most inefficient ways to sort a large array of integers.
      Nevertheless, it is an interview favorite. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n2).
      However, if the sample size is small, bubble sort provides a simple implementation of
      a classic sorting algorithm.
      Examples:
      Input:arr[] = { 4, 1, 3, 9, 7}
      Output: 1 3 4 7 9
      Input: arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
      Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
      Input :arr[] = {4,12,4,78,7,-1}
      Expected Result : {-1,4,4,7,12,78}
      Input :arr[] = {4}
      Expected Result : {4}
      Input :arr[] = [Empty]
      Expected Result : null
      Input :arr[] = {52,3,2}
      Expected Result : {2,3,52}
